# Page_View_Time_Series_Visualizer

This project was created as part of the course on the free Code Camp website:

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/page-view-time-series-visualizer

In this project I had to visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. I had to use Pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03.

Open project in Google Colab:
